      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>This is my <em>first ever</em> web page <strong>created entirely from scratch.</strong> Here are a few things about me:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>My name is Stephen.</li>
          <li>I live in San Jose, California.</li>
          <li>Soccer is my favorite sport.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This is how I know everything is fine:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I am healthy.</li>
          <li>There is a shelter in place order where I live.</li>
          <li>I am sheltering in place.</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Words to live by</h2>
      <h3>In times of uncertainty, it's important to remember to live life to the fullest.</h3>
      <p>Make plans, work, celebrate, be thankful, code on—and for now, maintain social distancing!</p>
      <blockquote>
        "The first action to be taken is to pull ourselves together. If we are going to be destroyed by an atomic bomb, let that bomb, when it comes, find us doing sensible and human things -- praying, working, teaching, reading, listening to music, bathing the children, playing tennis, chatting to our friends over a pint and a game of darts -- not huddled together like frightened sheep and thinking about bombs."
